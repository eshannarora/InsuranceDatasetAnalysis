* I found a travel insurance company's raw dataset. It comprises of various factors that affectes whether a person takes claim. "Claim" is a binary classified column. Perfomed data exploration, data preparation, data modelling and model evaluation. Modelled logistic regiression as the baseline model followed by two advanced models. The advanced models used are KNN Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes. Later on did hyperparameter tuning in logistic regression and KNN Classifier model and then compared the accuracy scores of all the models. The average accuracy of KNN with (n_neighbors=1) was more than the other models.
